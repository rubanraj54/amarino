**Amarino LAN is currently under development!**

### Many new features in Amarino 2.0 ###
  * control multiple bluetooth devices in parallel
  * visual feedback for events sent from the phone
  * plug-in concept to integrate your own events with Amarino (and using its visualizer for feedback)
  * support for Android 1.6 and 2.x devices (HTC Hero, Tattoo still won't work)
  * introduces an Android library to talk to Amarino from your own app
  * much clearer code

## Give it a try! ##

Note: _The HTC Desire has currently a bug in its Bluetooth implementation which causes reconnect not to work on SPP based communication._

<h3>Mission</h3>
Cell phones are great for communication in a virtual manner, but lack expressiveness in personal surroundings. Many people try to give their phones a personal touch by customizing them. 'android meets arduino' is a toolkit to connect Android-driven mobile devices with Arduino microcontrollers via Bluetooth. The toolkit provides easy access to internal phone events which can be further processed on the Arduino open-source prototyping platform. This toolkit seeks to empower people to externalize their phone events to creatively demonstrate them on wearables, living spaces, or other tangibles.

<h4>The idea</h4>
Normally smartphone events are tightly coupled to your phone device itself. When your cell phone is ringing, your phone speaker plays a ringtone. When you get a new text message, your phone displays it on its screen. Wouldn't it be thrilling to make thoses phone events visible somewhere else, on your wearable, in your living room, on your robot, in your office or where ever you want it to occur? Or would you like to use your smartphone sensors, like the accelerometer, light sensor, compass or your touchscreen to control other devices?

'android meets arduino' is a toolkit, basically consisting of an Android application and an Arduino library which will help you to interface with your phone in a new dimension. You can build your own interfaces almost without any programming experience.
